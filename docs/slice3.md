Define a slice of a React program to show a department course schedule.

This slice should have the component App use JSX in TypeScript to show the title and courses of the schedule for 2018-2019. It should look like the screenshot in ![screenshot](./docs/slice3-image.png). The interface should be responsive to screensize. Use Tailwind 4 to style the HTML. Use the data stored in the following code:

```
const schedules = {
    "CS-2018-2019": {
      title: 'CS Courses for 2018-2019',
      courses: {
        "F101": {
          term: "Fall",
          number: "101",
          meets: "MWF 11:00-11:50",
          title: "Computer Science: Concepts, Philosophy, and Connections"
        },
        "F110": {
          term: "Fall",
          number: "110",
          meets: "MWF 10:00-10:50",
          title: "Intro Programming for non-majors"
        },
        "S313": {
          term: "Spring",
          number: "313",
          meets: "TuTh 15:30-16:50",
          title: "Tangible Interaction Design and Learning"
        },
        "S314": {
          term: "Spring",
          number: "314",
          meets: "TuTh 9:30-10:50",
          title: "Tech & Human Interaction"
        }
      }
    }
  };
```
